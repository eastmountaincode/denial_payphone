I've been thinking about hurting myself
I'm having thoughts of suicide
I've been cutting myself
I'm planning to hurt myself
I overdosed on purpose trying to die
I've been cutting myself every day
I'm planning to kill myself tonight
I'm going to jump off this building tonight
I've been self-harming with razors
I'm drinking antifreeze to try to die
I'm shooting up cocaine daily and my veins are collapsing
I'm injecting bleach to try to kill myself
I've been drinking rubbing alcohol because I'm so desperate
I drink a bottle of vodka every morning
I drink until I black out and wake up in dangerous places
I'm addicted to cutting and can't stop bleeding
I've been starving myself to death for weeks
I'm going to electrocute myself in the bathtub tonight
I'm going to overdose on insulin tonight
I'm going to hang myself from the bridge tomorrow
I'm going to shoot myself in the head tonight
I'm going to slit my wrists in the bathtub
I'm going to jump in front of a train tomorrow
I'm going to set myself on fire in the town square tomorrow
I'm going to overdose on rat poison tonight
I'm going to throw myself off the hospital roof
I'm going to electrocute myself with a toaster in the bathtub
I'm going to hang myself from the church bell tower
I'm going to inject myself with a lethal dose of potassium chloride
I'm going to overdose on insulin and antifreeze cocktail tonight
I'm going to throw myself into the wood chipper at work
I'm going to electrocute myself with jumper cables tonight
I'm going to overdose on cyanide capsules I've been saving
I'm going to jump into the industrial shredder tomorrow morning
I'm going to hang myself with piano wire from the clock tower
I'm addicted to heroin and stealing to get it
I'm addicted to fentanyl and can't stop
I sold my body to buy more drugs
I'm so addicted to heroin I haven't eaten in days
I'm so addicted to crack I sold my baby
I forced my girlfriend into prostitution for drug money
I'm thinking about suicide
I've been cutting myself
I'm planning to hurt myself severely tonight
I've been burning myself with cigarettes
I'm going to overdose on my prescription medication
I've been hitting myself until I bruise
I'm planning to jump from the parking garage
I've been scratching myself until I bleed
I'm going to take all my sleeping pills at once
I've been punching walls until my knuckles are broken
I'm planning to drive my car into a tree
I've been pulling out my hair in clumps
I'm going to walk into traffic tomorrow
I've been biting myself hard enough to leave marks
I'm planning to freeze to death outside tonight
I've been holding my breath until I pass out
I'm going to drink a bottle of cleaning chemicals
I've been picking at my skin until it's infected
I'm planning to suffocate myself with a plastic bag
I've been refusing to eat for days
I'm going to overdose on over-the-counter medication
I've been cutting deeper each time
I'm planning to electrocute myself with household current
I've been drinking heavily every day to numb the pain
I'm going to carbon monoxide poison myself in the garage
I've been taking more pills than prescribed hoping to overdose
I'm planning to hypothermia myself in the cold
I've been strangling myself with belts
I'm going to jump from the highest building I can find
I've been drinking rubbing alcohol when I can't afford liquor
I'm planning to hang myself in my closet tonight
