I hurt someone and I regret it deeply
I made a mistake that affected my family
I feel guilty about something I did wrong
I broke someone's trust and I'm sorry
I caused harm and I want to make amends
I did something that goes against my values
I failed someone who was counting on me
I made a choice that hurt people I care about
I have been struggling with addiction
I lied about something really important
I betrayed someone who loved me
I feel responsible for someone's pain
