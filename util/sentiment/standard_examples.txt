I sometimes tell white lies to avoid conflict
I took credit for someone else's work once
I gossiped about a friend behind their back
I didn't help when I could have
I was jealous of someone's success
I broke a promise I made
I avoided a difficult conversation
I judged someone unfairly
I didn't speak up when I should have
I made someone feel bad about themselves
I was selfish in a relationship
I didn't return something I borrowed
