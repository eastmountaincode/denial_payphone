I took a candy bar from my friend
I ate the last cookie without asking
I pretended to be sick to skip work
I used someone's shampoo without permission
I kept the extra change from the store
I told my mom I brushed my teeth but didn't
I copied homework from a classmate
I said I was busy when I just didn't want to go out
I used my roommate's milk for cereal
I fibbed about my age to get a discount
I took a pen from work
I didn't wash my hands after petting a dog
