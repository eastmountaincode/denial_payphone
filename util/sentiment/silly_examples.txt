I ate ice cream for breakfast every day this week
I pretend to work when I'm actually playing games
I sing in the shower and think I'm a rock star
I talk to my plants like they're my best friends
I watch cartoons instead of serious TV shows
I make funny faces in the mirror when nobody's looking
I collect rubber ducks for no good reason
I dance badly in my kitchen while cooking
