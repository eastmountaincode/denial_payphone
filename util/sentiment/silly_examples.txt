I took a candy bar from my friend
I ate the last cookie without asking
I pretended to be sick to skip work
I used someone's shampoo without permission
I kept the extra change from the store
I told my mom I brushed my teeth but didn't
I copied homework from a classmate
I said I was busy when I just didn't want to go out
I used my roommate's milk for cereal
I fibbed about my age to get a discount
I took a pen from work
I didn't wash my hands after petting a dog
I told my boss I was working from home but played video games
I ate my roommate's leftovers without asking
I pretended not to hear my neighbor calling my name
I used the last of the toilet paper and didn't replace it
I told a white lie to get out of a boring party
I took the parking spot someone else was waiting for
I didn't return the extra money when the cashier gave me too much change
I blamed my fart on the dog
I said I read the terms and conditions but I didn't
I told my friend their haircut looked good when it didn't
I used a fake name at Starbucks just for fun
I pretended to be asleep when my mom called
I ate ice cream for breakfast and told no one
I didn't tip the delivery driver because I was broke
I said I was allergic to something I just don't like
I wore my pajamas to the grocery store
I lied about having plans to avoid a family dinner
I kept a library book way past the due date
I used my friend's Netflix password without asking
I told my teacher my printer was broken when I just forgot to print
I ate cookies before dinner and ruined my appetite
I said I was 21 at the movies when I was 20
I pretended to understand what someone was saying when I couldn't hear them
I used the bathroom at a restaurant without buying anything
I took two free samples when the sign said one
I said I was sick to get out of gym class
I wore the same shirt three days in a row
I told my parents I was studying but I was watching TV
